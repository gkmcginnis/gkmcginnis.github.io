        <h2>Normal Accidents</h2>
<p>I was introduced to Tim Harford's <i>Cautionary Tales</i> by means of Roman Mars' <i>99% Invisible</i>. The nested episode was<a href="https://timharford.com/2019/11/cautionary-tales-ep-3-lala-land-galileos-warning/" target="_blank"> Episode 3 - LaLa Land: Galileo’s Warning<a>. He covers the LaLa Land / Moonlight mix-up at the Oscars in 2017, and how the "safeguards" in the system used to deliver the envelopes with the winners actually caused more issues than saving the day. Give it a listen, it's only 30 minutes long and absolutely fascinating. He covers the core concepts of all the rambling below. 
</p>


<p>
The book used to explain the mechanics of that night was <i>Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies</i>, by Charles Perrow. Charles was inspired to investigate complex and potentially catastrophic systems after the Three Mile Island accident. His main argument was that in a system that is both <em>highly complex</em> and <em>tightly coupled</em>, failure is inevitable. <br>
You can also read Tim's article on Normal Accidents pre-Oscar fiasco <a href="https://timharford.com/2011/01/what-we-can-learn-from-a-nuclear-reactor/" target="_blank">here.<a></a>

<br> Below is a summary of the work in the book. 
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of interactions<br>
<b>Linear</b> - interactions of one component in DEPOSE (Design, Equipment, Procedures, Operations, Supplies/materials, and Environment) with one or more components that proceed or follow it immediately in the sequence of production. They are familiar and expected in the production/maintenance sequence. 
<br>Even if the ineractions unplanned,they are quite visible. 
<br>
<b>Complex</b> - when one component can interact with one or more outside of the normal production sequence, either by design or not. They are unfamiliar, unplanned, or unexpected. They are also not visible or immediately comprehensible. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
To explain the immediate effects one component has on another (or more), Charles describes the levels of coupling<br>
<b>Tight Coupling</b> - a mechanical term meaning there is no slack or buffer between two things. What happens in one directly affects what happens in the other
<br>
<b>Loose Coupling</b> =/= inefficient. It allows certain parts of the system to express themselves according to their own logic or interests
processing delays possible
</p>

<p>
He then plots how various industries, companies, and organizations land on these interactions. The upper-right quadrant posing the greatest potential risk given complexity, tight coupling, and catastrophic potential.

<p>
"When societies confront a new or explosively growing evil, the number of risk assesors probably grows. Whether they are shamans or scientists ... their function is not only to inform and advise the masters of these systems about the risks and benefits, but also, should the risk be taken, to legitimize and reassure the subjects." -p. 307

<p>
His conclusion with risky tech is to abandon, restrict, or tolerate and improve after basing on the cost of alternatives and net catastophic potential. Personally, I disagree with his stance on abandoning nuclear power, though I absolutely agree that serious consideration to balancing of redundant systems need to be taken into the highest regard. With the environmental changes and increased need for energy, nuclear provides clean and consistent energy. 
</p>
<p>

He has also recommended levels of centralization/decentralization of authority considering the type of coupling and complexity that should be adapted by various entities or industries.

His book was published two years before the space shuttle <i>Challenger</i> disaster.

<p>
Political and bureaucratic pressure to ignore engineers calling for a delay resulted in the loss of seven astronauts. This was an example of a tightly coupled system with little flexibility when it came to even minor component failiure.

<p>
What I take from this all:
<br>Redundancies made in the name of safety can sometimes cause more of a hazard or reduce reliability. 
<br>Next time you hear of a catastrophic failure that is reported to be the sole fault of one worker, be very skeptical. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to know more about "errors" on an individual scale, I would recommend Don Norman's <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>. I will probably do another summary like this in the future on that book.
