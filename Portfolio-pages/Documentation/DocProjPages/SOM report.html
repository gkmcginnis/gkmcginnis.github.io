    <h3>
        The following six pages contain a report I made for my previous employer, the Fred Fox School of Music at The University of Arizona. 

I took the initiative to compile a number of improvements to the way we operated. Having been a part of the team for five years in various roles, I believe my perspective would be useful for current and future employees.
<br>
<br>
I presented the report by requesting a round table discussion with three of my managers, as well as the newest employees 
to get the widest variety of feedback and discussion that I could. 
The report was printed and provided to each person with a pen for notes (after coffee and donuts of course) 
with 15 minutes of silent reading. 
What resulted was a very productive conversation on what could be changed, what couldn’t, 
and what actions to take next. For example, we began work on the instrument care sheet 
(page 4 of the report, the furthest left from this paragraph) after the meeting concluded. 
<br>
The results of that are on <a href="../DocProjPages/instrumentcleaning.html">this page↗</a>
