    <p>
        In a computer aided design class I took at Pima Community College, we were tasked with creating a model home for the 
        local Habitat for Humanity. The lot they were developing on was very unusual, as you can see immediately to the left. I was 
        selected as a finalist, and needed to present my design to the board of the local H4H. 
        <br>To improve my presentation, I took the initiative to create a handout to give to the board members 
        to allow them to analyze the design, and take home for further scrutiny.
