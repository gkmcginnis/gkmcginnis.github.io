    <h3>
        These two care sheets were made in an effort to reduce the amount of maintenance issues that come with a fleet of 
        band instruments. Through an annual check, we encountered quite a few moments that could have been mitigated with 
        routine cleaning by the user. These were intended to be slipped in the instrument case and be made publically available. 
        <br>
        Feel free to download and use them for your own band needs.
