        An emergency sign I created for the my previous employer.
The lack of signage I noticed around first aid kits and major doorways was disappointing, especially for such an important operation. Paper is cheap, lives aren’t.
I created a type of “narrative” structure with the sign. When in an emergency, it is very difficult to make even simple decisions, and seconds matter when dealing with serious enough medical issues. 
<br>
<br>
Most emergency signs fail on a number of accounts:
<br>
<br>
Why have to think of who to call?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why struggle to remember the address of the building?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What do I need to do once I call?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, the awkward dance of “it’s not like an <em>emergency</em> emergency but the toilet is busted and water and sewage is getting all over the lobby now, but I sure don’t want to call 911”
