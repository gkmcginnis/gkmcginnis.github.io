    <h2>5 rules of Organization</h2>
    Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncZ1mO8mA44" target="_blank">Van Neistat</a>
    
<h3>no stacks - one handed</h3>
    
    Do not stack dissimilar items, it invites chaos <br>
    Stack bowls with bowls, cups with cups, etc. <br>
    Place things so that they can be retrieved with one hand

<h3>kit your shit </h3>

Kit things that go together<br>
Kits stay where they are <br> 
Do not migrate the contents of the kits to others<br>
Do not migrate the kits themselves<br>

<h3>find your organizational talismans</h3>

What makes organization happen for you? <br>
Rubber bands, paper clips, binder clips, pins, markers, post-its

<h3>learn to build shelves</h3>

Shelves allow for easy retrievability <br>
Drawers are where things go to die

<h3>customize</h3>

Break from the default boxes that things come in.<br>
Consider your item(s) and the spaces they need to go.<br>
Can you use foam? wood? cut, screw, make it fit. 
<br>

<h3>notes from smart people</h3>

<h3>First Order Retrievability</h3>

Adam Savage talked about the importance of this while working in the shop at ILM (Industrial Light and Margic).
Creating his own toolbox, he customized everything to fit his needs and fit his tools exactly. <br>
<em>Every tool needs to be accessible without having to move another tool. </em>
<br>
<b style="color: crimson;">···</b>

<h3>Organizing in the middle of things</h3>

<p>
    "The key to staying ahead on a busy station is moving on a dish as soon as its name is out of (food runners) mouth-setting up the pan, doing the pre-searing, getting it into the oven quickly, making the initial moves. So that later, when the whole board is fluttering with dupes, I can still tell what I have working and what I have waiting without having to read the actual tickets again." 
    <br>-Anthony Bourdain, Kitchen Confidential
</p>
<p>
His work serves as a tracker of itself. His pans become his list. 
</p>

<h3>misc notes</h3>
<p>
Keep tools with the things they're made for. <br>
Do not use them for other tasks or move them away from their home.<br>
If maintained, you will not have the frantically to figure out the right size.<br>
Examples:<br>
I tape the allen keys that come with IKEA furniture to the bottom of that thing, so it'll always be with it. (this helped during my last few moves)<br>
Keep the wrench used to remove the arbor nuts of stationary tools, open access panels, etc. attached to the body of the tool (also, stop using an adjustable wrench on nuts for routine tasks and maintenance)<br>
Tie the chuck key to your drill press.<br>

<br><br>
Make most, if not all, surfaces at a universal height. Tables can then easily be positioned for improvised larger work areas.
