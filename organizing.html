    <h2>5 rules of Organization</h2>
    Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncZ1mO8mA44" target="_blank">Van Neistat</a>
    
<h3>no stacks - one handed</h3>
    
    Do not stack dissimilar items, it invites chaos <br>
    Stack bowls with bowls, cups with cups, etc. <br>
    Place things so that they can be retrieved with one hand

<h3>kit your shit </h3>

Kit things that go together<br>
Kits stay where they are <br> 
Do not migrate the contents of the kits to others<br>
Do not migrate the kits themselves<br>

<h3>find your organizational talismans</h3>

What makes organization happen for you? <br>
Rubber bands, paper clips, binder clips, pins, markers, post-its

<h3>learn to build shelves</h3>
