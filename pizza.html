    <h2>Pizza</h2>

    <p>
    I enjoy making pizza. I do not have the space for a pizza stone, pizza steel, a pizza oven, tossing, rolling, or messy countertops 
    <br>
    You can make delicious pizza at home. These will not be über thin new york margarita pizzas, but they get the job done and have excellent texture and flavor. 
</p>
<p>
    DO
    <br>get a kitchen scale <a href="#footnote"><span style="color: crimson;">*</span></a>
    <br>use bread flour. all purpose works fine though 
    <br>use high fat, low-moisture mozzerella
</p>

    <h3>Sheet Pan Pizza</h3>

    Best for dinner parties, or if you just want more pizza. <br>
    <br><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/spicy-spring-sicilian-pizza-recipe" target="_blank">Serious Eats Sicilian Pizza↗</a>
    
    <br>I follow their instructions exactly (I consult Serious Eats for most dishes and techniques. It is a fantastic resource with clear explanations of testing and results)
<br>Here's a quick breakdown of their measurements I scaled down for different pan sizes. The eighth sheets are great if there's a guest with a dietary exception.<br>
</p>

    <div>
        <table style="width: 80%;">
            <caption>all units are in <strong>grams</strong></caption>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th style="text-align: right;">half sheet</th>
                    <th colspan="3" style="text-align: center;">eighth sheet</th>

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody style="text-align: right;">
                <tr>
                    <td></td>

                    <td>×2</td>
                    <td>×4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>bread flour</td>
                    <td>500</td>

                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>oil</td>

                <tr>

                    <td>219</td>
                    <td>437.9</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
</p>
<p>
    To make the sauce:
    <ul>
        <li>20g extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>9 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>^heat all that for a minute in a pot, make your kitchen smell nice. Then add....</li>
        <li>one 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I make the dough about three days in advance if I can. Do a cold rise in the fridge, then take it out the morning of. Place in a well oiled sheet pan, then cover with plastic wrap as descriped in the guide. Allowing it to come to room temperature will allow you to easily stretch over the pan. 
    <br>Sauce > mozz > pepperoni. Top with peconino romano
</p>
<p>
    Favorite toppings other than sauce/cheese/pepperoni:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: 500;">Jalapeño Popper Pizza</span><br>
    Mix: cream cheese (2 blocks per half sheet), cheddar cheese, bacon, bacon fat, chopped jalapeño, garlic powder<br>
    <br>
    Spoon small chunks evenly over dough, then add:<br>
    more shredded cheddar cheese<br>
    bacon<br>
    sliced jalapeños<br>
    shredded cheddar<br>
    sliced shallot<br>
</p>
<p>
    I was inpired to pursue the sheet pan style pizza after going to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3qW6nmtpUydE373P9" target="_blank">Pie Punks</a> in San Francisco (excellent food, strong drinks, and cool atmosphere)

    <h3>Cast Iron Pizza</h3>
    Best for single or a couple, wouldn't reccomend for more than two people.<br> 
    Get a Lodge cast iron pan if you don't have one.<a href="#footnote"><span style="color: crimson;">**</span></a><br>
    It is a workhorse, and will outlive you.<br>
    
    Take what you like from the following videos
<br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYxB4QBlrx4" target="_blank">Adam Ragusea - Cast Iron Pizza↗</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDpCzJw2xm4" target="_blank">Adam Ragusea - New York-style pizza at home, v2.0↗</a>
    
    
   <br> Core cooking techniques should stay the same:
    <br>stovetop on
    <br>assemble while cooking bottom till golden/brown
    <br>put toppings <em>all the way to the edge</em>
    <br>in oven, broiler till crispy on top
</p>
<b style="color: crimson;">···</b>
<p>
    <a id="footnote"><span style="color: crimson;">*</span></a>pizza is in a wierd spot between baking and cooking. I have heard many people claim that they are bad at baking, I think the real reason is that they are bad at following directions. Baking is a science. Measure out everything when you're making the dough. 
    <br>Use a scale. The difference between table salt and kosher salt will make you appreciate measuring weight vs volume very quickly. 
</p>
<p>
    <a id="footnote"><span style="color: crimson;">**</span></a>Do not let nerds on the internet or your grandmother scare you when they describe their maintenance for cast iron. You <em>can</em> use soap and a sponge to clean it after use. The old advice of not using soap came from when lye was a main ingredient. Real seasoning is polymerized oil, you scraping the he cooked foodstuffs and cleaning with some Dawn will not "ruin the seasoning". Just don't put it through the dishwasher.
